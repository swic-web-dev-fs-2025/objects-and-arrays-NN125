## HW-4-reflection

### Skill Assessment

When I first started this lesson, I still had a decent idea about how objects and arrays worked in JS. Now after finishing this assignment, I was able to refresh my memory. Accessing them may seem confusing at first glance, but it as simple as `variable.object.method (map, find, filter, reduce, etc)`. Spread operators I remembered pretty vividly, as they are very essential for maximum immutability (`...object`). These make copies of existing data so the originals don't get affect by what you want to do with it. This assignment wasn't a walk in the park though, so Ai was used for when I was really stuck. At least I finally remembered to sign up for Copilot.

### React Readiness

I definitely feel the most confident with using the spread operator. Those can make quick and easy copies of needed data so I can mess with that instead of the originals. With that said, I could definitely use a little more practice with array methods.
